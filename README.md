# rasql

`rasql` (pronounced “rascal”) is an all-in-one SQL tool for Go.

It provides:

* PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and Google Cloud Spanner dialects.
* Schema definitions written as Go code, including generation from live database metadata.
* Type-safe result-set access.
* Dynamic query building at runtime.
* Static query building with templates.

The project requires Go 1.26 or newer and uses parameterized types where they improve type safety or avoid conversions.

The `schema`, `query`, `render`, `row`, and `runtime` packages cover the main application path. The `inspect` package normalizes live table columns and primary keys. The `generate` and `template` packages produce deterministic Go source.

`rasqlgen schema` generates Go table descriptors from a JSON schema snapshot. `rasqlgen query` generates a parameterized Go function from a restricted SQL template. Both commands reject unchecked template actions and preserve values as bound arguments.

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the architecture and focused implementation history.
